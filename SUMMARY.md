# Project Completion Summary

## ✅ All Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Initialize jj repository ✓
- Initialized jj repository with `jj git init`
- Created 6 commits documenting the development process

### Task 2: Extract Julia code from Pluto notebook ✓
- Created `heat_neural_ode.jl` - clean Julia file without Pluto markup
- Split into separate `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files
- Commit: "Extract Julia code from Pluto notebook and create standard Julia project"

### Task 3: Instantiate Julia environment ✓
- Ran `julia --project=. -e 'import Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'`
- All dependencies installed successfully
- Commit: "Instantiate Julia environment"

### Task 4: Create training framework ✓
Created `training_framework.jl` with:
- ✅ `generate_heat_equation_data()` - solves heat equation for training data
- ✅ `generate_multiple_runs()` - collects data from multiple simulation runs
- ✅ `calculate_rmse()` - evaluates model performance
- ✅ `save_model()` / `load_model()` - model persistence functions
- ✅ `train_model()` - trains any model architecture
- Commit: "Add training framework with data generation, RMSE, and save/load functions"

### Task 5: Implement three model approaches ✓
Created `models.jl` with three architectures:

1. **Simple Neural ODE** (`create_simple_neural_ode()`)
   - Direct neural network learning the ODE dynamics
   - Architecture: Flatten → Dense(N², 2N²) → Dense(2N², N²) → Reshape

2. **Encoder-NODE-Decoder** (`create_encoder_node_decoder()`)
   - Encoder compresses to latent space
   - Neural ODE learns dynamics in latent space
   - Decoder reconstructs full state
   - Architecture: Encoder(N² → N²/4) → NODE → Decoder(N²/4 → N²)

3. **Convolutional Neural Network** (`create_cnn_model()`)
   - Uses Conv layers to preserve spatial structure
   - Architecture: Conv(1→8) → Conv(8→16) → Conv(16→8) → Conv(8→1)

Commit: "Add three model implementations: simple Neural ODE, encoder-decoder, and CNN"

### Task 6: Training script ✓
Created `main_training.jl`:
- Trains all three models on the same dataset
- Uses 5 training runs with different initial conditions
- Each model trained with Adam (50 iters) then BFGS refinement
- Saves all three models to `.jls` files
- Reports RMSE for each model

### Task 7: Model loading script ✓
Created `run_saved_models.jl`:
- Loads each saved model from disk
- Runs inference on test data
- Computes and displays RMSE
- Commit: "Add scripts to run saved models and generate result plots"

### Task 8: Plotting functionality ✓
Created `plot_results.jl`:
- Generates three visualization files:
  1. `model_comparison.png` - Time series comparison
  2. `heatmaps.png` - Spatial distribution at final time
  3. `scatter_comparison.png` - Scatter plot comparison
- Commit: "Add scripts to run saved models and generate result plots"

### Task 9: Documentation ✓
Created comprehensive documentation:
- `README.md` - Full project documentation
- `QUICKSTART.md` - Quick reference guide
- Commit: "Add comprehensive README documenting the project structure and usage"
